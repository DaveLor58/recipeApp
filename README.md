# Recipe App
Created Using React-App

## Program Description 
For this app, I wanted to further understand how to create an app using React.js and JavaScript
which includes React web hooks. 
Additionally, this app implements an API, 'edamam', which gives the app access to different 
types of recipes as well as data regarding ingredients, calories, etc.

As such, creating the app has also allowed me to understand more about API functionality and the 
types of API requests and dealing with json objects.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
